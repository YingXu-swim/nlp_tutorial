    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part-of-speech tagging** (**POS tagging**) is the process of annotating words in an input sequence with their corresponding part-of-speech labels. Word's **part-of-speech** gives us more information about the word itself and about its neighboring words (nouns are preceded by determiners \"a dog\" and adjectives \"nice dog\"). For instance, we can use POS tags as features for the Named Entitity Recognition task: Proper Nouns like names are usually these entities. Moreover, a word's **part-of-speech** provides us with an understanding of how to pronounce this word: cOntent if it is a noun and contEnt if it is an adjective. This helps in such tasks as speech synthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we're going to create two systems for assigning POS tags. They are both based on statistics collected from a corpus annotated with POS tags by humans. First, we will be assigning words the most frequent tag it has been seen with. This is a **baseline** we will be trying to beat. Second, we will create a **Hidden Markov Model** **HMM** system and compare its performance to our baseline. The POS tagging algorithm is judged by how **accurate** it is. So we are going to use **accuracy** as the performance metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we will be using [the GUM corpus](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/) annotated with [Universal Dependencies POS tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/). We recomend to study the tags, to understand what each of them means.\n",

Each cell corresponds to the number of times a column tag was seen after a row tag in our training corpus.\n",

We also add the start and end probabilities to this matrix, so it has $N+1$ x $N+1$ dimensions. The **row** $a_1$ represents the probabilities of each tag to start a sentence.

The probabilities of $V_{i,j}$ are computed by starting from the most probable of the extensions of the paths that lead to the current cell. It might sound very complicated now, but you will see what's going on in later steps. \n",

In the example below, we're trying to estimate the probability of \"right\" being an \"ADJ\" ($V_{0,2}$). We want to know: what would be the most probable path that led to the word \"right\" being tagged with \"ADJ\". Was it 'ADJ' 'red' or was it 'NOUN' 'red'?

In this example, we want to remember that 'right' as 'ADJ' came from the previous word (\"red\") marked as 'ADJ'. So we set the backpointer  to zero $P_{0,0}=0$.
